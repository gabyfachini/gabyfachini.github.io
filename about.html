      <h3>WHO I AM</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Gaby, passionate about sports, connections, and cultures. I believe people are what truly matter—a perspective strengthened during my military service in the Brazilian Air Force. I've always been fascinated by how businesses work, shaping my strategic outlook.
      </p>

      <h3>ACADEMIC BACKGROUND</h3>
      <p>
        Food Engineer from USP and Business graduate from FAM, I am currently studying Information Systems at XP Educação. I specialized in Aircraft Electronics and Radars at EEAR. Currently, I am self-studying Software and Machine Learning, aiming for a Master's in AI in Europe.
      </p>

      <h3>A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CAREER</h3>
      <p>
        My path includes roles in Admin, Operations, UX, Development, and Software Architecture. I also founded an e-commerce business, gaining a 360° view of digital systems. Leadership and empathy are my pillars: I've been a volunteer since 2019 and a community leader since my military application days.
