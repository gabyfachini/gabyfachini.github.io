I have always loved learning. Books, conversations, experiences… everything is an opportunity to observe, analyze, and connect ideas. However, it was a very special piece of feedback that pushed me to take the step of starting this blog.

A friend who has been part of my life for many years and has seen me through different moments—from professional to personal life—told me something that stuck with me. She noticed that I have a capacity for "macro-vision": the ability to see the big picture and connect dots that, for many people, seem unrelated.
According to her, this perspective is rare, valuable, and crucial in any management or decision-making process.
This wasn't the only feedback of this kind I had received, but it was enough to spark a question: 
Why not share more of what I have learned throughout my life?

One example that always stands out to me is when I decided to take a military entrance exam. With only three months of study, I achieved 3rd place nationwide.
More than just dedication, this achievement came from the way I analyzed information, organized knowledge, and applied skills I had developed throughout my life—often informally, through curiosity and practice.
I also realized in other projects that when I share my analyses and strategies with people, they find paths and solutions they couldn't see before. It’s as if small insights can open up new possibilities.

That is why this blog is born without the pressure of frequent posts, but with the intention of bringing content that makes sense and truly adds value.
Here you will find reflections, strategies, and lessons that blend technology, career, personal development, and life stories—because it’s all connected.

Welcome!

Because, in the end, knowledge only makes sense when it is shared. ✨
